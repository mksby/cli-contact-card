# cli-contact-card

Hey there, so this repo basically contains a [stylised contact card](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mtroitski) to the npm registry, so that you can run it direclty from your CLI using

```
npx mtroitski
```

Full courtesy of [whitep4nth3r](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/build-a-business-card-cli-tool/) for 90% of the code and the idea.

## Install

Clone the repo, install the dependencies `npm i`, `pnmp i`, `yarn` and run `node index.mjs` to check how it works.

## Linkage (verify npx)

To test the `npx mtroitksi` behavior, run the `npm link` command in your folder and then run `npx mtroitksi` from a new terminal. Should work!

No additional tests provided

## Publish

Publish by logging into `npm` via `npm login` and providing your credentials. Then hit `npm publish` to publish it to the registry!
